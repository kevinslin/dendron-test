# Publishing ðŸš§

Dendron lets you publish the contents of your vault, either in its entirety or only a subset. Notes are published under the [dendron-jekyll theme](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-jekyll). 

## Features

### Nested Hierarchies

dendron-jekyll supports the same nested hierarchies as your notes and allows you to navigate via the sidebar.

### Lookup

If you'd rather not click, dendron-jekyll also supports path based lookup.

### Permanent Ids

Every page is published using its unique ID which means that urls will never change, even if the filenames do.

### Free hosting, custom domain names and SSL Certs

If you have a free github account, then you can host your Dendron notes for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

### Jekyll Liquid Tags and Variables 

You can find the docs on this under [[liquid| dendron.topic.liquid]]
- NOTE: this will only be "compiled" in the published site but won't be rendered in the regular markdown

### Selective Publication

You can choose to publish your whole vault, a single domain, or multiple domains within your vault.

- ~~NOTE: It is not currently possible to publish multiple domains. If you would like this feature, you can vote for it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues/64)~~

## dendron.yml

This config file controls what gets published. It is located at the root of your workspace. Below is a sample config.


```yml
site:
  # the note that will serve as the root of your published website
  # by default, dendron will set the root to `root`
  # 
  # this means the contents of `root.md` will be set as your home 
  # page and that all the contents # of your vault will be published
  # 
  # you can change the root to a specific `domain` 
  # this will set that `domain` as the home page
  # and publish everything under that domain
  noteRoot: home
  # specify domains that you want to publish
  noteRoots: [home, books]
  # there's usually a built step before publishing your site
  # eg. converting your markdown files into jekyll-compatible
  # markdown files
  # 
  # this controls where the new documents will be published
  siteRoot: docs

```

### Example publishing entire vault
- vault
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ root.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.quickstart.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.zen.md
â”œâ”€â”€ flowers.md
â””â”€â”€ flowers.bud.md
```
- dendron.yml
```yml
publish:
  root: root
```
- what gets published

```
.
â””â”€â”€ root.md
    â”œâ”€â”€ dendron
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.quickstart
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dendron.zen
    â””â”€â”€ flowers
        â””â”€â”€ flowers.bud
```

### Example publishing just one domain
- vault
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ root.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.md
â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.quickstart.md
â””â”€â”€ dendron.zen.md
```
- dendron.yml
```yml
publish:
  root: dendron
```
- published:

```
.
â””â”€â”€ dendron
    â”œâ”€â”€ dendron.quickstart
    â””â”€â”€ dendron.zen
```

## Steps

### Pre-requisites
- Make sure you have a `docs` folder inside `dendron.rootDir`.
    - If you've created your workspace using `Dendron: Initialize Workspace` on 0.4.2 or later, this is already done 
    - If you've created your workspace before `0.4.2` or have manually created your workspace, you can run `Dendron: Doctor` to create this folder
/pages/)
- Setup a github repo with [github pages enabled](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/)
  - when selecting the source, make sure to pick `master branch/docs folder`

- Create an initial commit and push your vault to your github page

### Guide
1. Depending on what notes you want to publish, you will want to update your `dendron.yml` file. By default, everything will be published
1. Update the contents of `_config.yml` inside your `docs` folder to specify site wide configuration like logo and title.
    - NOTE: this is located relative to `dendron.rootDir`
    - if you do not have a `docs` folder, you can run `Dev:Dendron: Doctor` to create one
2. When you are ready to publish, run the `> Dendron: Build Pod` command to prepare your site for publication. This builds your notes into the `siteRoot` directory which defaults to `docs`. `Build Pod` does the following when it builds your site:
    - copies over the notes specified in `dendron.yml`
    - creates a copy of your notes with the ids in place of the file names 
    - updates all `wiki-links` to `markdown-links` so Jekyll can process it, preserving titles if there are any
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push your repository using `> Git: Push`

## Advanced

### Exclude from publication

To exclude a page from publication, you can add the following to the frontmatter:

```yml
...
published: false
```

### Exclude line from publication

Sometimes, you just want to keep a few lines private while publishing the rest of your vault. You can do that with `Local only`. In order to mark a line as `Local Only`, add the following markdown comment at the end of the line: `<!--LOCAL_ONLY_LINE-->`

```markdown
Hello World!  <!-- Will be published -->

This is a secret <!--LOCAL_ONLY_LINE--> <!-- won't be published -->
```
