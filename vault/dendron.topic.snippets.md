# Snippets

Snippets are templates that you can trigger to automatically insert text that you use on a regular basis. Examples include meeting note templates, contact details and recipes. 

You can read about how to work with snippets [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets).

Dendron automatically comes with snippets. They are available at in the following file: `vault/.vscode/dendron.code-snippets`. You can see a copy of it [here](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-template/blob/master/vault/.vscode/dendron.code-snippets).

You can modify snippets by using `> Preferences: Configure User Snippets` and selection `dendron.code-snippets`.

# Using Snippets

You can use intellisense to preview snippets and use `tab` key to complete them.
