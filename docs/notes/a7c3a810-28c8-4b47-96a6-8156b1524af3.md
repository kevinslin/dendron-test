# Lookup

To work with notes, Dendron uses  **lookups**. Lookups help you navigate a hierarchal corpus of notes.

## Notes

### Finding Notes

Below is an example of a simple two level hierarchy with notes on various [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) commands. Use `CMD+L` (we are going to use mac keybindings for this tutorial) to bring up the lookup and try some of the following queries.

```
- cli.tar
- cli.curl
- cli.dig
```

### Creating Notes

While we call it the `Lookup Bar`, you can also use it to create notes that don't exist. When you lookup for a note that hasn't been created, Dendron will create it for you. 

To try it yourself, bring up the lookup bar. Type `dendron.lookup.hello` and hit `Enter`.

Dendron is all about reducing the friction between you and the information you care about. Therefore, there is no difference between entering and looking for information.

After you've created the note, you can click the 'x' next to the tab to come back to this screen.


### Deleting Notes

To delete `dendron.lookup.hello`, use the `CMD-SHIFT-D` shortcut on the note that you want to delete. Alternatively, you can also launch the `Command Bar` and type `Dendron: Delete Node` 

## Schemas

Dendron also provides lookup for [schemas](c5e5adde-5459-409b-b34d-a0d75cbb1052). To lookup a schema, use `> Dendron: Lookup Schema` or the `cmd+shift+L` (`ctrl+shift+L` on windows and linux) shortcut to bring up the schema lookup.

### Finding Schemas

The process for finding schemas using Dendron is the same as that for finding notes. One lookup to rule them all.

### Creating Schemas

Just like with notes, if you enter the name of a schema that does not exist, Dendron will create it for you.

Specifically, Dendron will create `{value}.schema.yml` in your vault. At this point, you are free to edit the schema. After you're satisfied with the result, you'll need to run [> Dendron: Reload Index](eea2b078-1acc-4071-a14e-18299fc28f47) for it to take affect. 

- NOTE: if you get an error after running `Reload Index`, it is most likely because your YAML is malformed. You can paste it in [yaml lint](http://www.yamllint.com/) to check that you are using the correct yaml syntax.

### Deleting Schemas

The process for deleting schemas using Dendron is identical to deleting notes.
